Notes:
 1.  I created this particular example in response to finding a similar function bit of code on Planet Source Code 
      didn't work in Windows 9x but worked beautifully in Windows 2000 and above.
 2.  I make no allowances for suitability of purpose.  I just wrote this to show there is a way.
 3.  This is not complet code in any way.  I fully expect people will want to encapsulate this in class modules
      and ActiveX modules.  More power to you.  I originally developed this idea and used in some software
      I wrote for my former employer.  Unfortunately the users didn't like it so it was scrapped.  After a while
      I began to understand their distaste.
 4.  No, I will not likely be updating this posting.

All that said, here are things I would change if I had the inclination:
 1.  Encapsulate as a class module.
 2.  Use a different type of progress bar, more than likely one or more of the countless thousands to be found
      on Planet Source Code.
 3.  Add text showing the percentage complete.
 4.  Make options for all of the above so the programmer using this method call could pop up a horizontal, a vertical,
      a round, or odd shaped progress bar with or without text or just text with no progress bar.
 5.  Make it more dynamically sizable.

If you have any questions email me:  thevbman@earthlink.net

If enough people ask for it I might be more inclined to add the aforementioned changes.

Best of coding...
